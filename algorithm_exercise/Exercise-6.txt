Calculating the area of rectangle
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare length, breadth, area
Step 3: Take input for length and breadth from user
Step 4: area= length*breadth
Step 5: Output area
Step 6: Stop

Calculating the area of square
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare side
Step 3: Take input for side
Step 4: area= side*side
Step 5: Output area
Step 6: Stop
