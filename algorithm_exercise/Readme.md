# Exercise - Problem Solving Technique  

#### Objective : Write Algorithms

In this exercise the learner is expected to write algorithms for 10 problem statements

The Algorithm technique, helps the learner to identify the steps required to be performed for generating the expected outcome.

This is usually, the first step implemented in the problem solving approach
