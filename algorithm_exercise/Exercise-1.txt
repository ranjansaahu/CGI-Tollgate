Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide the first number by second and display their quotient.

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Assume that num1, num2 and quotient are the three variables.
Step 3: Accept the user's first input, num1.
Step 4: Accept the user's second input, num2.
Step 5: To get quotient divide num1 by num2. 
Step 6: Output quotient.
Step 7: Stop
