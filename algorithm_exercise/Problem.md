# Exercise - Writing Algorithms  

**The learner has to write algorithms on the problem statements given here.** (***Refer to the Instructions section for pushing the solution files to git***)

### Problem Statements

The 10 problem statements for the algorithm exercises are listed below.

Please ensure that the steps written are numbered and are logical. Ensure all branches should converge at a point before the program ends

#### Exercise 1:-
Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers, divide the first number by second and display their quotient.

#### Exercise 2:-
Write an algorithm for accepting distance in kilometers, convert it into meters and display the result.

#### Exercise 3:-
Write an algorithm for accepting five numbers and display the sum and average of the numbers.

#### Exercise 4:-
Write an algorithm for accepting a number and display the whether it is odd or even.

#### Exercise 5:-
Write an algorithm for accepting two numbers and display the highest number among two.

#### Exercise 6:-
Write an algorithm for calculating the area of rectangle and square separately.

#### Exercise 7:-
Write an algorithm for accepting the distance and speed values for a particular journey, calculate the time taken for the journey and display the same.

#### Exercise 8:-
Write an algorithm for accepting a character and then display whether it is a vowel or a constant.

#### Exercise 9:-
Write an algorithm for accepting three numbers and display the highest number among the three numbers.

#### Exercise 10:-
Write an algorithm for accepting the age of user and if the age is valid, check whether the user is a kid, a teenager, an adult or a senior citizen.

### Instructions

1. Fork the [boilerplate](https://gitlab-cgi.stackroute.in/stack_problem_solving_techniques_boilerplates/algorithm_exercise) repository
2. In the machine locally, clone the boilerplate repository and change directory to the folder containing cloned code
3. For each individual exercise, the boilerplate contains a separate markdown file. Put your algorithms in these files
4. Push the code everytime after an exercise is attempted.
5. Ping the mentor over Slack for queries and/or exercise completion status updation.
